ANNOTATION BASED CONFIGURATION:----
—-------------------------------------------------
Annotated a class with @Component annotation. @Component creates beans for us.
Use @ComponentScan annotation to specify package name for scanning those classes that are annotated with @Component annotation.
Use @Autowired annotation to automatically inject the Spring bean.
Use @Qualifier annotation to avoid the confusion between multiple Spring beans of the same type.
Create Spring IoC Container(Application Context) and Retrieve Spring bean from Spring IoC container.
If we don’t give a specific name to @Component then the IoC container puts the name as class name but the first letter as small. Ex- Class ->class
